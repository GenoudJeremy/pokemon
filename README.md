## Welcome to this amazing project !

You arrive in a new mission. This is where your travel begins.
Your client want to create a custom front application where he'll could find, a lot of information about ... Pokemon
In fact, that client he's a nerd and a huge fan about that little monsters. 

Your mission, create that application.

### Specifications :
- Application should have a menu with two main tab : Pokemon list, Random Team. By default, pokemon list should be the open tab
- The client authorizes the use of components library like Material, Bootstrap or Clarity (or other)

#### 1 - Menu
Without menu, no navigation.
Create your own menu with two tabs "Pokemon list" and "random team"

#### 2 - Pokemon List

On that tab, the client wants :
- a table of all Pokemon with that columns :
    - pokedexId
    - name
    - generationId
    - image

When you click on a pokemon, you'll be redirect on page with specifics informations on that pokemon :

Be careful, that page could be shared and return the same result at refresh.
